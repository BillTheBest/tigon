Tigon Release Notes
============================================

Release 0.2.1
=============

Bug Fix
---------

- Fixed a problem in TigonSQL which mapped all schemas to a default interface set,
  resulting in incorrect outputs. Instead, we now have a single interface per input schema
  with no default interface set. Modified Flows that use TigonSQL to adhere to this
  approach.


Release 0.2.0
=============

Features
--------

- Retrieving live logs in distributed mode is available through  the ``showlogs`` CLI command.
- The `Tigon Apps repo <https://github.com/caskdata/tigon-apps>`__ is now available at GitHub. 
  It contains realtime use case applications built using Tigon.
- The ``libcurl`` dependency of TigonSQL has been removed.

Bug Fixes
---------
- A problem with passing Runtime arguments when in Standalone Mode has been fixed.
- A problem with logging when in the Standalone Mode has been fixed.
