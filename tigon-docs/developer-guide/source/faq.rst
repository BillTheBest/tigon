with a consensus-building phase, similar to Apache's voting process. If you’d like to help
make Tigon better by adding new features, enhancing existing features, or fixing bugs,
here's how to do it:

1. If you are planning a large change or contribution, discuss your plans on the `tigon-dev`
   mailing list first.  This will help us understand your needs and best guide your solution in a
   way that fits the project.
#. Fork `Tigon <https://github.com/caskco/tigon>`__ into your own GitHub repository.
#. Create a topic branch with an appropriate name.
#. Work on the code to your heart's content.
#. Once you’re satisfied, create a pull request from your GitHub repo (it’s helpful if you fill in
   all of the description fields).
#. Address all the review comments.
#. After we review and accept your request, we’ll commit your code to the 
   `cask/tigon <https://github.com/caskco/tigon>`__ repository.
