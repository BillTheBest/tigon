Tigon Command-Line Interface
============================

Introduction
------------

The Command-Line Interface (CLI) provides methods to interact with a running Tigon
instance from within a shell, similar to HBase shell or ``bash``. It is automatically
started once you start Tigon in `Distributed Mode </admin#distributed-mode>`__.

.. highlight:: console

The executable should bring you into a shell, with this prompt::

  tigon >

To list all of the available commands, enter ``help``::

  tigon > help

To list all Flows currently running in Tigon, use::

  tigon > list
  
To stop the Flow prior to shutting down distributed mode, use::

  tigon > delete <flow-name>

You can then exit the command-line interface either with ``quit`` or ``Control-C``.

These are the available commands:
