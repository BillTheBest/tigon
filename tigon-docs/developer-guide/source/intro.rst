Tigon Introduction
============================================

Tigon is a high-speed stream database. Tigon's original purpose was network monitoring, though
there are many other applications that can take advantage of its features:

- Ability to handle extremely large data flows;
- Data is touched only once, useless data is not gathered, and results are quickly produced;
- Runs collections of queries using pipelined query plans and a SQL-like language;
- Supports a significant amount of parallelization; and 
- Able to transparently handle complex record routing in large parallelized implementations.

Getting Started
---------------

Prerequisites
.............

Tigon is supported on *NIX systems such as Linux and Macintosh OS X.
It is not supported on Microsoft Windows.

To install and use Tigon and its included examples, there are a few prerequisites:

  1. JDK 6 or JDK 7 (required to run Tigon; note that $JAVA_HOME should be set)
  2. GCC
  3. G++
  4. libcurl (if it is not already included in your operating system)
  5. Apache Maven 3.0+ (required to build the example applications)
  
### Build

You can get started with Tigon by building directly from the latest source code::

```
  git clone https://github.com/cask/tigon.git
  cd tigon
  mvn clean package
```

After the build completes, you will have a distribution of Tigon under the
`tigon-distribution/target/` directory.  

Take the `tigon-<version>.tar.gz` file and unzip it into a suitable location.

For more build options, please refer to the [build instructions](BUILD.md).
