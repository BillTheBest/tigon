# SQLJoinFlow

## Overview
An application that demonstrates the capabilities of tigon-sql library.
It does an inner-join of two data streams and logs the result of the SQL command.

## Flow Runtime Arguments
When starting the Application from the command line, runtime arguments will need to be specified.

The only required property is:

"httpPort" - The port to run the HTTP ingestion endpoints on.

To deploy the Application to a standalone instance of Tigon:
```
$ ./run_standalone.sh /path/to/SQLJoinFlow-0.1.0.jar cco.cask.tigon.sqljoinflow.SQLJoinFlow [ host-property ]
```

The Flow exposes 2 ingestion endpoints:
```
POST /v1/tigon/ageInput -d { "data" : [ <id>, <age> ] }
```

```
POST /v1/tigon/nameInput -d { "data" : [ <id>, <name> ] }
```

The output is the inner-join of these two input streams on their ``id``s. A filter of age greater than 40 is applied
on the results.

The output will look like:

```
<id> : <name> : <age>
```
