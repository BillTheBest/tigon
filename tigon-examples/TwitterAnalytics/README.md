# TwitterAnalytics

## Overview
An application collects Tweets and logs the top 10 hashtags used in the last minute.

## Twitter Configuration
In order to utilize the ``TweetCollector`` flowlet, which pulls a small sample stream via the Twitter API, an API key and Access token must be configured.
Follow the steps at [Twitter oauth access tokens](https://dev.twitter.com/oauth/overview/application-owner-access-tokens) to obtain these credentials.
These configurations must be provided as runtime arguments to the Flow prior to starting it in order to use the ``TweetCollector`` flowlet.

## Flow Runtime Arguments
When starting the Application from the command line, runtime arguments may need to be specified.

The required Twitter authorization properties ("oauth-properties") include all of these:

"oauth.consumerKey" - See ```Twitter Configuration``` above.

"oauth.consumerSecret" - See ```Twitter Configuration``` above.

"oauth.Token" - See ```Twitter Configuration``` above.

"oauth.TokenSecret" - See ```Twitter Configuration``` above.


## Installation

Build the Application jar:
```
MAVEN_OPTS="-Xmx512m" mvn package -DskipTests -pl tigon-examples -am -amd -P examples
```

To deploy the Application to a standalone instance of Tigon:
```
$ ./run_standalone.sh /path/to/TwitterAnalytics-0.1.0.jar co.cask.tigon.analytics.TwitterAnalytics [ oauth-properties ]
```

To deploy the Application to a distributed instance of Tigon:
```
$ ./run_distributed.sh <ZookeeperQuorum> <HDFSNamespace>
> START /path/to/TwitterAnalytics-0.1.0.jar co.cask.tigon.analytics.TwitterAnalytics [ oauth-properties ]
```

The top ten hashtags used in the previous minute get recorded. In the case of standalone instance of Tigon,
the results will appear immediately in the Tigon command line interface; in the case of distributed instance of Tigon,
the results will be written to the logs of the YARN container of the Flowlet.
